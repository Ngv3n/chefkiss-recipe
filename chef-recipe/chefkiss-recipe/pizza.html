<p>This is a great pizza recipe where you don't have to wait for the dough to rise. 
    You just mix it together and let it rest for 5 minutes then it's all ready to go! 
    It yields a chewy crust.</p>

<b><u>INGREDIENTS</u></b>

    <ul>
    <li>1 cup of warm water</li>
    <li>1 package of dry yeast</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon of sugar</li>

    <li>2 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
    </ul>

<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 230 degrees C, and lightly grease a pizza pan.</li>
    <li>Place warm water in a bowl; add yeast and sugar. Mix and let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add flour, oil, and salt to the yeast mixture; beat until smooth. You can do this by hand or use a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook to make it easier.</li>
    <li>Let it rest for 5 minutes</li>
    <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a 12-inch circle.</li>
    <li>Transfer to the prepared pizza pan.</li>
    <li>Spread crust with sauce and toppings of your choice.</li>

</ol>
